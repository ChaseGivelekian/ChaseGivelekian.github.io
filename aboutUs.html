            <h3>Randy Korzinski</h3>
            <p>CEO</p>
            <p>
              Randy is a very driven man with a passion that has no rivals.
              Randy created this business model after knocking back a few
              non-alcoholic beverages. While he is a stern leader, he has
              compassion for his more over-zealous workers, especially those who
              show more of a likelihood to him. On a more personal note though,
              Randy spent his summer vacation of his senior year working almost
              daily. He worked at an Assisted Living home named Danbury for
              $14/hr. There he grew as a person with the patience to rival even
              a Shaolin monk.
