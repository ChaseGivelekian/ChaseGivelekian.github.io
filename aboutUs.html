                <p>
                    We are a team of dedicated professionals committed to
                    connecting businesses with top temporary talent. Our mission
                    is to help individuals with enough coin, paper, and or credit thrive by providing flexible staffing
                    solutions when they need it most.

                        <h3>Randy Korzinski</h3>
                        <p>CEO</p>
                        <p>
                         Randy is a very driven man with a passion that has no rivals. Randy was able to come up with this 
                            business model after knocking back a few non-alcoholic beverages. While he is a stern leader,
                            he has compassion for his more over-zealous workers, especially those who show more of a likelihood to him.
                        On a more personal note though, Randy spent his summer vacation of his senior year working almost daily.
                            He worked at an Assisted Living home named Danbury for $14/hr. 
                            There he was able to grow as a person with the patience to rival even a Shaolin monk.
