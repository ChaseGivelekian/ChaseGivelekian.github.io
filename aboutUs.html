                        <h3>Randy Korzinski</h3>
                        <p>CEO</p>
                        <p>
                            Randy is a very driven man with a passion that has
                            no rivals. Randy created this business model after
                            knocking back a few non-alcoholic beverages. While
                            he is a stern leader, he has compassion for his more
                            over-zealous workers, especially those who show more
                            of a likelihood to him. On a more personal note
                            though, Randy spent his summer vacation of his
                            senior year working almost daily. He worked at an
                            Assisted Living home named Danbury for $14/hr. There
                            he grew as a person with the patience to rival even
                            a Shaolin monk.
